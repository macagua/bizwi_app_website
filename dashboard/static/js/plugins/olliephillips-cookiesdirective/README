jquery.cookiesdirective.js - the jQuery plugin
demo.html - good place to start, if you're trying to set this up
external.js - a javascript file to grab and load to the DOM, when cookies accepted or implied consent mode running

Version 2.0.1
=============
- .live('click'... replaced with .click() as former deprecated 
- Removed old 1.5.js script from this package

Version 2.0.0 
=============
- jQuery is ubiquitous. Script isn't checking/finding/loading it for you anymore
- Rewritten as a jQuery plugin
- Options. Lots of them. Configure lots of things
- Implied consent mode. For the UK. The ICO said it's ok. So less clicking and won't hold back your cookie setting scripts.

Version 1.5
===========
- Old javascript version. No longer maintained.
